Com puters vs. Books

Mia Murphy was tired when she got home from school last Friday. It had been a long week—
she was working on a computer project and had stayed late at school to finish her work. After
stepping off the bus and trudging home, she plopped onto her chair in the kitchen.

”What’s up, Mia?” Mr. Murphy asked. He was making Mia her favorite after—schoo| snack, a
grilled cheese sandwich.

”This project is taking me forever!” Mia replied. ’’I have to design a website page for my
computer class.”

”Wow, fancy!” Mrs. Murphy shouted from the living room. ”When we were in middle school,
we didn't even know how to use computers.” She walked into the kitchen and sat down next to
Mia. She asked her daughter if she had anyone to help her with her project.

”We have partners—mine is named A|i,” she explained. ”Today we learned how to insert
pictures into our page!”

Mr. and Mrs. Murphy looked at each other and smiled. Mia noticed their little exchange.
"What?” she asked, wondering what they were thinking.

"Well, we first met when we were working on a project together in high school,” Mr. Murphy
explained. ”We were assigned to do a research project on American Indian history.”

Mrs. Murphy chimed in. ”But we didn't have computers back then, so we had to go to the library
every day to do research!” She explained that they didn't have online search engines to help
them with their work; they could only rely on books. They didn't have cell phones to text each
other when they needed he|p—they had to work together at each other’s houses.

”But that sounds so hard!” Mia said. ”I can't imagine completing a project without the help of a
computer.”

Mr. Murphy chuckled. "I know. But I have that project to thank for meeting your mom! All those
countless hours in the |ibrary...we had to spend a lot of time together,” he said.

Now Mia was curious. She wondered what else was different when her parents were growing
up. So she asked.

Mrs. Murphy started to list off things she didn't have as a child, like an mp3 player and a flat-
screen television. ’’Also, since I had many brothers and sisters, we had to pitch in more. I helped
my mom cook dinner, and we repaired our clothes ourselves when they tore,” she said, tapping
Mia on the nose. ”How about you help me cook dinner tonight then?” Mrs. Murphy suggested,
laughing.

"Sure!” Mia exclaimed. ”How about something that you used to make as a kid?”

”Chicken noodle soup it is,” Mrs. Murphy said with a smile.

8. Why does Mia’s mother think her computer class homework is “fancy”?

Suggested answer: Because when Mia’s mother was in school, students didn’t even know how to use
computers. Computers seem like a modern luxury to her.

10. What is one way that Mia’s life is different from her mother’s? How do you know? Use evidence from
the passage to support your answer.

Suggested answer: Answers may vary and should be supported by the passage. Possible answers
indude

0 Mia uses computers to complete her homework, while her mother had to complete her projects by
doing research in the library. We know because Mia’s mother tells her that when she was in middle
school, they didn’t even know how to use computers.

0 Mia uses cell phones to contact her partner, while her mother and father had to work together at
each other’s houses. We know because Mia’s mother tells her this, and Mia thinks that sounds
hard, so we can infer that Mia does not have the same problems.

o Mia may have an mp3 player and a flat—screen television, while her mother does not. Mia also does
not pitch in as much as her mother’s family did, cook dinner or repair her own clothes. We can
infer this because these are the answers Mia’s mother thinks of first when her daughter asks her
what was different about her life.
